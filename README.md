# Totle
A .NET Totle API for ERC20 CryptoCurrencies, do swaps and payments.

## Note: still in development, not finished, but mostly all done.

# Usage
Create a .NET C# project for performing swaps and/or payments with Totle. You can build the project to a dll and add it as a reference to your
application. This does require an aspect of nodeJS for performing smart contracts which is the server.js and you need to run it along side
your project. If you want you could also integrate ccxt into the nodejs code to benefit with other exchanges to buy, sell, withdraw, etc. with
other exchanges.
